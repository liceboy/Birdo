# birdo is a pretty sick game in the works

currently, need to finsish roll ability to go invincible but cannot shoot. 
need to figure out making enemies spawn in patterns
need to make more enemies
need to make bosses
need to make condition that if all enemies are dead check if enough score is earned. if enough, win!!! else lose 
possible extraneous death animations and whatnot
need to add sprites
