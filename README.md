# birdo is a pretty sick game in the works

currently, need to finsish roll ability to go invincible for short period, but cannot shoot. 	this roll ability will be integrated alot in boss fights, where boss will probably shoot some undodgeable move. 

need to figure out making enemies spawn in patterns

need to make more enemies

need to make bosses

need to make condition that if all enemies are dead check if enough score is earned. if enough, win!!! else lose 

possible extraneous death animations and whatnot

need to add sprites

final birdo have 4 main levels- woods, city, beach sky each with unique colored birds and its own boss. each level will have a 
moving background as the level progresses. each level will have its own niche- environmental hazards or unique bird abilities. after each level has been completed, birdo will get to choose or simply is upgraded in terms of stats. in each level, birdo will be facing lots of bullet hell that he must utilize roll to avoid. in order to proceed to the next level, birdo must score enough points but still live. game should be fairly difficult- can only take 3 hits at woods. 

as birdo progresses, will shoot more feathers, shoot faster, shoot more eggs, eggs will deal splash, possibly slow, levels WILL have enemies based around eggs. hp will only increase to a max of 5. powerups could be added in each level- heals, boosts, etc. changes are of course subject to change based on testing. 

when birdo is killed, play a death animation while the game is still running for around 3-5 seconds, then game over screen. when other birds are killed, play animation where they plummet. when boss dies, play its animation which will be similar to birdo's - then he zooms off and cuts to a powerup choose screen or proceeds directly to the next level, (some kind of zoomy transition). once victory has been obtained (entire game beaten). display score and various stats, such as enemies defeated, feathers shot, etc. possible leaderboard for high scores or best scores. 

the game will progressively become more difficult in each level. final sky boss should be retarded hard. possible space level in future. 
each boss has its own patterns and unique attacks. will probably need more sprites for some. take a few extra seconds before the boss, once the boss enters, have his hp bar animate up to full while he flexes and then begin fight. could have some cool feather shot patterns. 

for the ui, Im thinking feathers for each hp, cool looking score, a timer. pause button. 

no humans, only interactions in each level

cutscenes??!?!?

sound and music ?!!!?
 
if we make it to here- damn
