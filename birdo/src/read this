possible features to be added in the future:
	eggs should have AOE / scattershot
	player should be getting stronger each section/level, maybe we will just make a player that extends the first player 
	suicideBomber: shoots only when dead, will also be considered dead when close enough to the player, thus shooting
	healthbar of whatever is being shot in the top middle 
	miniboss: simpler boss with like 15 health with 1 - 2 attk patterns
	boss: should have multiple phases based on health, maybe one method that runs through all his phases? 
	hazards: woods: tree branches/snakes dangling from trees (lmao), hunter that shoots after an indicator
			 city:  power lines, smoke that slows you down, reduces vision, and/or damages you
			 beach: kinda dont know, aquatic creatures/ big waves?
			 sky: rain, lightning, wind, pretty much all weather effects could be implemented
some things to think about:
	shooting enemies should almost always be some kind of homing shooter unless in specific situations
	enemies should sometimes be stalling out, not every enemy should just run across the screen at dx = -3
	i'm thinking of making a enemy in which we can just manipulate its dx/dy, need a collision enemy besides chargingEnemy
	should we be making the window bigger?
	should enemy feathers be slower? everything feels sort of cancerous to dodge
